# Authentication

Two login methods feed the same session model (a `sessions` row → bearer token).

| Method | State | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Magic link** (email) | Fully implemented | Needs outbound email, which is **off** (no paid plan). In **dev/staging** the request endpoint returns the token directly (`devToken`) so you can log in without a mailbox; in **production** it does not. |
| **Sign in with Apple** | Server + web redirect flow **implemented + tested**; native (iOS) client wiring + Apple config required | The primary login for deployed environments (works without email). |

## Sign in with Apple

There are two client shapes, both landing on the same verifier + session model:

- **Native (iOS)** posts an identity token directly — `POST /auth/apple`.
- **Web** can't obtain a token in-page, so it uses Apple's browser **redirect**
  flow through a server-hosted **Return URL**: `/auth/apple/start` → Apple →
  `/auth/apple/callback` → back to the SPA. See "Web redirect flow" below.

### How token verification works
Whichever path supplies it, the Apple **identity token** (an RS256 JWT) is
verified by `apps/api/src/lib/apple.ts`:
1. fetches Apple's JWKS (`https://appleid.apple.com/auth/keys`), selects the key
   by the token's `kid`, and RS256-verifies the signature (WebCrypto);
2. checks `iss == https://appleid.apple.com`, `aud ∈ APPLE_CLIENT_IDS`, `exp`,
   and — when supplied (web flow) — the `nonce`;
3. maps the token's `sub` to an `identity(provider='apple')` → user → session.

If `APPLE_CLIENT_IDS` is unset `POST /auth/apple` returns **501** (Apple disabled).

### Web redirect flow (the Return URL)
The web client has no native Apple SDK, so it drives the OAuth redirect flow.
The **Return URL** — the value you asked about — is this API's own callback:

```
<PUBLIC_ORIGIN>/api/auth/apple/callback
```

(e.g. `https://staging.igt.kylebjordahl.com/api/auth/apple/callback`). Register
this exact URL on the web **Services ID**. It's derived from the `PUBLIC_ORIGIN`
env var (below) — you don't configure the Return URL separately. The flow:

1. **`GET /auth/apple/start`** — the browser navigates here (the "Continue with
   Apple" button). The server mints a `state` + `nonce`, stores them in a
   short-lived signed cookie (`igt_apple_oauth`, `SameSite=None; Secure; HttpOnly`),
   and 302-redirects to `https://appleid.apple.com/auth/authorize` with
   `client_id=<Services ID>`, `redirect_uri=<Return URL>` (derived as
   `<PUBLIC_ORIGIN>/api/auth/apple/callback`),
   `response_type=code id_token`, `response_mode=form_post`, `scope=name email`,
   and the `state`/`nonce`.
2. The user authenticates at Apple; Apple **form-POSTs** the `id_token` (+ echoed
   `state`) to **`POST /auth/apple/callback`** (the Return URL). The SameSite=None
   cookie rides along on this cross-site POST.
3. The callback checks `state` against the cookie (login-CSRF guard), verifies the
   `id_token` (incl. the round-tripped `nonce`), issues a session, and
   302-redirects the browser to **`/app/#session=<token>`**. The token is in the
   URL **fragment** (never sent to a server / logged); the Flutter SPA reads it on
   load (`lib/util/web_auth.dart`), stores it, and strips the fragment.
   Failures redirect to `/app/#auth_error=<code>` instead.

The Return URL isn't its own config value — it's derived from **`PUBLIC_ORIGIN`**
(the public scheme+host this deployment is served on) as
`<PUBLIC_ORIGIN>/api/auth/apple/callback`. If `APPLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID` or
`PUBLIC_ORIGIN` is unset, `/auth/apple/start` and `/auth/apple/callback` return
**501** (web flow disabled); native `/auth/apple` still works.

### What you need to configure

**Apple Developer (developer.apple.com):**
1. Enable the **Sign in with Apple** capability on your App ID (the iOS bundle
   id, e.g. `com.yourco.caretaker`).
2. For the **web** client, create a **Services ID** (e.g. `com.yourco.caretaker.web`).
   Under its Sign in with Apple config, register the **domain** and the **Return
   URL** `<PUBLIC_ORIGIN>/api/auth/apple/callback` (see "Web redirect flow" above).
   Web needs a verified domain + an associated private key.
3. The token's `aud` is the **bundle id** (native) or the **Services ID** (web).

**This API:** set `APPLE_CLIENT_IDS` to the allowed `aud`(s), comma-separated.
For web, also set `PUBLIC_ORIGIN` (the public origin — the Return URL is derived
from it) and the Services ID as `APPLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID` (plain per-env vars in
`wrangler.jsonc`; `APPLE_CLIENT_IDS` can be a var or a secret):
```bash
cd apps/api
echo "com.yourco.caretaker,com.yourco.caretaker.web" \
  | pnpm wrangler secret put APPLE_CLIENT_IDS --env staging
# Web redirect flow (edit these in wrangler.jsonc per env):
#   PUBLIC_ORIGIN       = https://staging.igt.kylebjordahl.com
#   APPLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID = com.yourco.caretaker.web   # must also be in APPLE_CLIENT_IDS
#   → derived Return URL to register at Apple:
#     https://staging.igt.kylebjordahl.com/api/auth/apple/callback
```

**Flutter client (not yet wired):**
1. Add the [`sign_in_with_apple`](https://pub.dev/packages/sign_in_with_apple)
   package and, in Xcode, add the **Sign in with Apple** capability/entitlement.
2. On the login screen:
   ```dart
   final cred = await SignInWithApple.getAppleIDCredential(
     scopes: [AppleIDAuthorizationScopes.email, AppleIDAuthorizationScopes.fullName],
     nonce: sha256Hex(rawNonce), // recommended — see below
   );
   // POST { identityToken: cred.identityToken } to /auth/apple → { sessionToken }
   ```
3. Store the returned `sessionToken` the same way the magic-link flow does.

### Nonce (replay protection)
The **web** flow already binds a `nonce`: `/auth/apple/start` mints it, round-trips
it through Apple, and `/auth/apple/callback` passes it to `verifyAppleIdentityToken`,
which asserts `payload.nonce == nonce`.

The **native** `POST /auth/apple` path does **not** yet — to harden it, have the
client generate a random nonce, send its SHA-256 to Apple
(`getAppleIDCredential(nonce: sha256(rawNonce))`), send the **raw** nonce to the
API alongside the token, add `nonce` to `AppleSignInInput`, and pass
`nonce: sha256(rawNonce)` into `verifyAppleIdentityToken`.

### Server-to-Server Notification Endpoint (Apple → us)
When you configure Sign in with Apple on the **primary App ID**, Apple offers a
**"Server-to-Server Notification Endpoint"** field. This is **not** part of the
login handshake and is **not** where the identity token is sent — it's a separate
HTTPS URL Apple calls, out of band, to tell us about **account-lifecycle changes
the user makes on Apple's side** (in iOS Settings → their Apple ID → *Apps Using
Apple ID*), long after they've signed in. It's configured once and covers **all**
sign-in surfaces (native and web) — despite living under the App ID it isn't
native-only.

Why it matters: without it, we never learn that a user revoked access or deleted
their Apple ID, so their `identities(provider='apple')` row and any relay email we
cached would silently go stale.

**How it works.** Apple sends an HTTP POST whose body is `{ "payload": "<JWS>" }`
— a JWT signed by Apple (verify it against the same JWKS + issuer we use for the
identity token, with `aud` = our client id). Its decoded `events` claim carries:

| `type` | Meaning | What we should do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `email-disabled` / `email-enabled` | User toggled forwarding of their private-relay address | Update the stored email / stop relying on it |
| `consent-revoked` | User revoked our app's access | Treat as sign-out: drop the identity + invalidate sessions |
| `account-delete` | User deleted their Apple ID | Delete the user/identity (data-retention obligation) |

The endpoint must return `200` quickly and is unauthenticated at the transport
level — trust comes from **verifying the JWS signature**, not from the caller.

**Status: not yet implemented.** There's no route wired for this today. When we
add it, register `<PUBLIC_ORIGIN>/api/auth/apple/notifications` (or similar) in the
App ID config, verify the JWS with the existing helpers in `apps/api/src/lib/apple.ts`,
and act on the `events` above. Until then, revocation/deletion done on the Apple
side won't propagate here.

## Google Calendar — OAuth (delivery target, not a login)

The Google Calendar delivery provider needs an OAuth token. A pasted access
token still works but expires in ~1h; the proper flow stores a **refresh token**
and exchanges it for a fresh access token at delivery time.

### Configure
1. In **Google Cloud Console** → APIs & Services → Credentials, create an
   **OAuth client ID** (Web application). Add your **redirect URI(s)** (the same
   value the client sends — e.g. a small page that displays the `code`, or a
   custom scheme for native). Enable the **Google Calendar API**.
2. Set the client on the API:
   ```bash
   cd apps/api
   # ID can be a plain var (wrangler.jsonc) or a secret; secret for the secret:
   echo "<client-id>"     | pnpm wrangler secret put GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID --env staging
   echo "<client-secret>" | pnpm wrangler secret put GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET --env staging
   ```
   Unset ⇒ `POST /families/:id/google/authorize-url` returns 501 and the OAuth
   path is disabled (paste-token still works).

### Flow
1. Client calls `POST /families/:id/google/authorize-url { redirectUri }` →
   consent URL (requests `access_type=offline` + `prompt=consent` so Google
   returns a refresh token).
2. The user approves; the client captures the `code` from the redirect and sends
   it on the target credential as `{ authCode, redirectUri }`.
3. The server exchanges the code for a **refresh token** (stored encrypted). At
   delivery, `GoogleCalendarProvider` gets a fresh access token via the
   server-held client secret. Re-authorizing on edit replaces the stored token.

> Note: `prompt=consent` is required to receive a refresh token; without it
> Google may return only an access token (the API responds `google_no_refresh_token`).

## Onboarding a caretaker (no email)
Until email is enabled, add caretakers with the **invite/share-link** flow (see
the Family tab): an admin creates the member, shares the code, and the invitee
signs in (Apple, or magic-link `devToken` on staging) and redeems the code to
link their account to that member. See `docs/` and the `/invites` endpoints.
