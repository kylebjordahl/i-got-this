# Caretaker Calendar Platform

Family logistics planner (v1): ingest school/calendar feeds, classify events
into pickup / drop-off / attendance **tasks**, assign a caretaker owner, and
push full-detail events to caretaker calendars (email/iMIP, CalDAV, Google).
Multi-tenant (a **family** is the tenant). Backend on Cloudflare; client in
Flutter (iOS + web). See the full plan in
`~/.claude/plans/i-want-to-develop-valiant-puffin.md`.

## Layout

```
apps/
  api/         Cloudflare Worker — Hono API + Cron + Queue (D1 via Drizzle)
  mobile/      Flutter app (iOS + web) — plain flutter project, NOT Nx-managed
libs/
  domain/      Zod schemas + shared types (OpenAPI contract source of truth)
  db/          Drizzle schema + D1 migrations + tenancy helpers
  ical/        ical.js (parse/RRULE) + ical-generator (VEVENT) + tsdav (CalDAV)
  classification/  rule engine (explicit create + exception cancel/shift/ignore)
  delivery/    DeliveryProvider interface + registry (providers land in Phase 4)
infra/terraform/ Cloudflare infra (Terraform); Wrangler owns worker code
tools/         OpenAPI → Dart client codegen
```

## Prerequisites

- **Node 22** (`.nvmrc` → 22.23.1): `nvm install && nvm use`
- **pnpm 9** via corepack: `corepack enable && corepack prepare pnpm@9 --activate`
- **Flutter SDK** (for `apps/mobile`) — see `apps/mobile/README.md`
- **Terraform ≥ 1.9** (for `infra/terraform`)

## Common commands

```bash
pnpm install                       # install workspace deps

pnpm nx run-many -t typecheck      # typecheck all TS projects
pnpm nx run-many -t test           # unit + workerd integration tests
pnpm nx run @igt/db:generate       # regenerate D1 migrations from schema

pnpm nx run @igt/api:dev           # wrangler dev (local API)
pnpm nx run @igt/api:db-migrate-local   # apply migrations to local D1
```

## Status

**Phase 0 (scaffold & platform) complete and verified:** monorepo, API worker +
D1/Drizzle, classification engine, OSS-lib workerd spike, Flutter shell,
Terraform skeleton, CI pipeline. 18 tests passing across 4 projects; all 6
projects typecheck. Next: Phase 1 (identity & tenancy).

> Note: the Flutter SDK and Terraform CLI are not provisioned by the Node
> toolchain; install them to run `apps/mobile` and `infra/terraform` locally.
> CI installs Flutter via `subosito/flutter-action`.
